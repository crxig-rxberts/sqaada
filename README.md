# TODO Application

## Project Description

This is a TODO application that will be used for users to create task on a TODO list. They will be able to set TODO's as flagged, meaning urgent and also complete tasks to give the ability to monitor which tasks are done, which tasks are a top priority and which tasks are a TODO but can be done at a later date. This application can be used to track shopping lists or daily activities.

## The main features are :

- Create a TODO list
- Delete a TODO list
- Add a TODO to the TODO list
- Edit a TODO on the TODO list
- Delete a TODO on a TODO list
- Set a TODO to be complete or a priority
